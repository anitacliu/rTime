# rTime
rTime is a mental and physical health resource website for students in Covid-19, built using HTML/CSS/JavaScript. 

Covid-19 has had a powerful impact on many students' lives, from interrupting daily livelihoods to causing emotional stress & anxiety. My Kode With Klossy project team decided to compile a website of resources to aid students in this pandemicâ€”to remind those working from home that they should not downplay the impacts of quarantine on their physical and mental health. We hope that our website is able to provide the users a safe space to feel heard and a gentle reminder to love and care for themselves too.
