    <p class = "text"> We are a team of three that met through Kode With Klossy’s 2020 web development program. We are young women who sought opportunities to learn more about coding and to find a community of diverse underrepresented groups in STEM. Given the opportunity to explore our passions by creating and coding a website, we chose to tackle the subject of mental health. Our member, Alex S, specifically wanted to provide resources for everyone ranging from our community, Gen Z, to the often left out Millenial generation. rTime is a website dedicated specifically to providing specialized resources that pertain to mental and physical health during the 2020 pandemic. We wanted to remind those students and adults working from home that they should not downplay the impacts of quarantine on their physical and mental health. We hope that our website is able to provide the users, a safe space to feel heard and a gentle reminder to love and care for themselves too✨✨✨ </p>
