      <p class="paragraph1"> With Covid-19 sheltering people at home indefinitely, remote work is a routine experience. Whether it be work or school, students and adults alike experience Zoom fatigue—an overwhelming burden of physical discomfort and emotional distress—with the increased time spent in front of a screen. 
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph2"> It is not uncommon to feel drained after a day of work, but even more so when that day of work entails sitting at your desk and completing the day's tasks almost entirely from your laptop—working on projects, meeting with teammates, socializing, and even shopping.
