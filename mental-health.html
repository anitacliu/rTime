    <p class="descriptionContent">Being stuck at home drives us all a little stir-crazy. The inability to spend time with friends, have entertainment, and see anyone else but those you live with hurts us all. There are many studies pointing to the negative effects that a quarantine put in place to protect us caused on our mental health.</p>
    <p class="descriptionContent">We know that fighting mental health issues is a very difficult process which, unfortuantely, has been worsened by the well-intended stay-at-home orders. That's why we at rTime have curated a collection of accessible resources to help you get your mental health, stress, anxiety, and more under control. </p>

      <p> For many at-home workers during this pandemic, connecting with nature is difficult. Perhaps itâ€™s due to living in the city with limited greenery, maybe your city is stricter on leaving the house, or maybe youâ€™re restricting yourself from going outside due to older/younger members of your household. Either way, it can be difficult nowadays to remember how important fresh air and frequent, tactile contact with greenery is. Here are some options that you may be able to employ in order to bring nature into your apartment, or to improve the overall atmosphere that your new workspace provides. </p>

      <p>Many are teleworking full-time for the first time, isolated from co-workers, friends and family. Our daily living routines are disrupted causing added anxiety, stress and strainâ€”physically, mentally, and financially. It is completely natural for this disruption and uncertainty to lead to anxiety and stress. Now more than ever, we all must take care of our mental health and well-being. As we protect ourselves against potential exposure to the coronavirus, keep in mind that social distancing does not mean social isolation. This resource provides practical tips on taking care of our mental health and well-being.</p>

      <p>It is easy to fall into a pattern of negligence during this pandemic; with so many tragedies happening around the world your own problems seem to be the least pressing. You might be aware of your growing restlessness at this time, of the pressure to keep your grades/work productivity high, of the anxieties that are pushing you to work extra hard to keep your job, or even the troubles of having lost your job and trying to stay afloat. It is easy right now to feel as though the stress is piling up and you have to strive for perfection. However, as Shauna Shapiro, PhD, and many other scientists communicate, research has continually shown that self-compassion and common humanity during times of stress can allow for more room for growth and productivity. Take some time to become aware of both the issues surrounding you in the world and in your own brain. </p>

      <p>Sometimes it takes more than just mindfulness to help reduce anxiety. Being aware of your stress and of the mental repercussions is extremely important. For many, it takes more than just awareness to help trick your body out of its fight-or-flight mode and into a calmer state. Heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback rewires your bodyâ€™s natural response to high-intensity situations and optimizes heart rate oscillations. With frequent practice and awareness of the situations that sets your stress response off,you can help create a more soothing environment for both your brain and body while you work from home.</p>
